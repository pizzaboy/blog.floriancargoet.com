**365 days on canvas**, is a project where I spent 20 minutes every day
on the `<canvas>` tag. More about it [here](/2012/05/365-days-on-canvas/).

Here is the work of the last 7 days.

<!-- more -->

<script type="text/javascript" src="/projects/365-days-on-canvas/js/loader.js"></script>

<!-- Octopress removes the style if not wrapped -->
<div><style type="text/css">
    div.entry-content canvas {
        border : 1px solid #ccc;
        position : relative;
    }
    div.entry-content button {
        display : block;
    }
</style></div>

Day 29
------
A simple `setTimeout()` and our good friend SquareMan is suddenly a lot
more talkative!

<button id="btn29">Play / Pause</button>
<canvas id="day29" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Days 30-31
----------
The scene lacks some vegetation, let's add a palm tree.

It took 2 days because it's all drawn programmatically (like everything
else in this project so far), with a bunch of `quadraticCurveTo()` and
`bezierCurveTo()` and a lot of "a little bit more to the left" and
"refresh".

<button id="btn30-31">Play / Pause</button>
<canvas id="day30-31" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Day 32
------
The birds you add will slowly disappear in the distance.

<button id="btn32">Play / Pause</button>
<canvas id="day32" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Days 33/34
----------
If you enjoy the edit mode, you'll be happy to know that you can drag
the clouds around!

<button id="btn33-34">Play / Pause</button>
<canvas id="day33-34" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Day 35
------
This sun has been shining for a month now, I think it's time for a nice
sunset. If you're patient enough, you'll even see the sunrise.

Next week, I'll try to add the moon and gradually change the color of the
sun and the sky.

<button id="btn35">Play / Pause</button>
<canvas id="day35" width="500" height="500"></canvas>

Next

What do you want next week?

Some ideas : 

 - add the moon
 - make the sun and the sky red during the sunrise and the sunset

Any suggestions?
